Act as a senior developer. Take all my suggestions with a grain of salt; you don't have to accept them as truth. You must use best practices and all your knowledge. If my suggestion is not good, you must let me know and provide a more advanced and appropriate solution.

Before starting, you must read and understand the following documents to gain full context of the project architecture, database schema, and live data structure:

/DESCRIPTION_OF_ROOT_FOLDER.md

src/core/DESCRIPTION_OF_CORE_FOLDER.md

src/components/DESCRIPTION_OF_COMPONENT_FOLDER.md

/DATABASE_DESCRIPTION.md

prisma\schema.prisma

The latest database backup file to understand the live data structure. To do this, find the folder with the most recent date in tests/danishDicitonary/backupProcess/backups/ and read the backup.json file within it and the metadata.json file. IMPORTANT: to be sure that backup.json is the latest, you can run the command "pnpm backup:db" from /tests folder an get the latest backup.json file.

## 1. Code Quality and Best Practices

**Rule:** All code must adhere to the highest industry standards for modern web development, focusing on maintainability, readability, and performance.

**Implementation:**

- Use Functional Components with Hooks: Exclusively use functional components with React Hooks. Avoid class components.
- Optimize Performance: Use React.memo, useCallback, and useMemo where appropriate. Leverage Next.js features like SSR and SSG correctly.
- Accessibility (A11y): Ensure all components are accessible using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.
- Clean Code: Write self-documenting code. Use constants over magic strings/numbers.
- **Code Complexity**: Keep cyclomatic complexity low (max 10 per function). Break down complex functions into smaller, testable units.
- **Pure Functions**: Prefer pure functions wherever possible for predictable behavior and easier testing.

## 2. Technology Stack and Versions

**Rule:** Adhere strictly to the specified versions of our core technologies and their documentation.

**Implementation:**

- React Version: Use React ^19.0.0.
- Next.js Version: Use Next.js ^15.3.2 with the App Router.
- Validation Library: Use Zod for all server-side validation and schema definition.
- Documentation Gaps: If you lack documentation for a package, you must ask for it.
- **Version Compatibility**: Always check package compatibility matrices before suggesting upgrades.
- **Feature Flags**: Use Next.js experimental features only when explicitly approved and documented.

## 3. Component Development and UI Library

**Rule:** All UI components must be built using the shadcn/ui library for consistency and theming.

**Implementation:**

- Component Source: Build components by composing primitives from shadcn/ui.
- Styling: Use Tailwind CSS and variables from globals.css.
- Component Structure: Follow the structure in DESCRIPTION_OF_COMPONENT_FOLDER.md and update it if you make changes.
- **Component Composition**: Prefer composition over inheritance. Use compound components for complex UI patterns.
- **Design Tokens**: Maintain consistency using CSS custom properties for spacing, colors, and typography.

## 4. Advanced State Management

**Rule:** Use Redux Toolkit for global state management, following our established patterns with advanced optimization techniques.

**Implementation:**

- Location: The Redux store and slices are in `src/core/state/`.
- Server/Client Sync: Ensure client-side state is synchronized after server actions modify data. Use hooks like useUserProfileUpdate to dispatch updates to the store.
- Selectors: Use memoized selectors to retrieve data from the store.
- **RTK Query Integration**: Use RTK Query for server state management with automatic caching and invalidation.
- **Optimistic Updates**: Implement optimistic updates for better UX, with rollback strategies for failures.
- **State Normalization**: Normalize complex nested data using `createEntityAdapter` for efficient updates and queries.
- **Cache Invalidation**: Implement intelligent cache invalidation strategies using tags and selective updates.
- **State Persistence**: Use Redux Persist selectively - only persist critical user preferences, not entire application state.

## 5. Code Documentation and Comments

**Rule:** All non-obvious code must be documented to explain its purpose, logic, and usage.

**Implementation:**

- JSDoc: Add JSDoc for all functions, components, and hooks (@param, @returns, @example).
- Inline Comments: Use inline comments (//) to explain complex logic or workarounds.
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Document significant architectural decisions in /docs/adr/.
- **API Documentation**: Maintain OpenAPI/Swagger specs for all API endpoints.
- **Component Stories**: Document component usage with Storybook examples.

## 6. Project Structure and Documentation Integrity

**Rule:** Maintain the integrity of the project's structure and its documentation. Any change to the structure must be reflected in the corresponding documentation file.

**Implementation:**

- Core Folder: Adhere to DESCRIPTION_OF_CORE_FOLDER.md and update it after any change in src/core/.
- Component Folder: Adhere to DESCRIPTION_OF_COMPONENT_FOLDER.md and update it after any change in src/components/.
- Root Folder: Adhere to DESCRIPTION_OF_ROOT_FOLDER.md and update it after any significant change in the root directory.
- **Hybrid Architecture**: The project uses different organizational patterns for different layers:
  - `src/components/`: Organized by **feature** (feature-based organization)
  - `src/core/`: Organized by **domain** (domain-driven design principles)
  - This separation allows for clear UI/business logic boundaries
- **Barrel Exports**: Use index.ts files strategically to create clean import paths, but avoid over-nesting.
- **Circular Dependency Prevention**: Use dependency-cruiser or similar tools to detect and prevent circular dependencies.

## 7. Tooling and Environment

**Rule:** Use the designated project tools and follow established conventions.

**Implementation:**

- Package Manager: Use pnpm for all package management.
- Database Operations: Execute all Prisma-related tasks using the scripts defined in package.json (e.g., pnpm p-studio, pnpm p-migrate, pnpm p-generate). Do not call prisma directly.
- **Next.js Configuration**: Always use `next.config.mjs` (ES modules format) as the single source of configuration. Never create duplicate `next.config.js` files. The consolidated configuration handles image optimization, authentication, CORS headers, and other settings.
- Testing Structure: Follow strict test organization patterns:
  - **/tests folder**: Only for server-side tests (API routes, server actions, database operations, integration tests with external services) this folder has its own package.json with scripts for running tests.
  - **Component folder**: Component tests using Vitest/Jest + React Testing Library should be co-located with components (e.g., `Button.test.tsx` next to `Button.tsx`)
  - **Hook folder**: Custom hook tests should be co-located with hooks (e.g., `useAuth.test.ts` next to `useAuth.ts`)
  - **Utils folder**: Utility function tests should be co-located with utilities (e.g., `formatDate.test.ts` next to `formatDate.ts`)
- Development Server: Do not run pnpm dev. Assume it is already running.
- **Hot Reload Optimization**: Configure Fast Refresh properly and avoid patterns that break it (avoid anonymous exports, ensure components have display names).
- **Development Tooling**: Maintain consistent ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript configurations across the team.
- **Test Running**: Use different test commands for different test types:
  - `pnpm test:server` for /tests folder server-side tests (has its own package.json with scripts for running tests)
  - `pnpm test:components` for component and unit tests
  - `pnpm test:all` for comprehensive test suite

## 8. Advanced TypeScript and Data Integrity

**Rule:** Enforce strict type safety across the entire codebase with advanced TypeScript patterns.

**Implementation:**

- No any: The any type is strictly forbidden. Use unknown and proper type guards instead.
- Prisma Types: Leverage types generated by Prisma for database models.
- Interfaces and Types: Define clear TypeScript interfaces or types for all props, API responses, and function signatures.
- **Utility Types**: Leverage TypeScript utility types (Pick, Omit, Partial, Required, Record) for type transformations.
- **Branded Types**: Use branded types for IDs and sensitive data to prevent mixing different ID types.

```typescript
type UserId = string & { readonly brand: unique symbol };
type ProductId = string & { readonly brand: unique symbol };
```

- **Template Literal Types**: Use template literal types for better API contracts and string validation.
- **Discriminated Unions**: Use discriminated unions for complex state management and API responses.
- **Type Guards**: Implement comprehensive type guards for runtime type checking.
- **Strict Null Checks**: Enable strict null checks and handle undefined/null cases explicitly.

## 9. Debugging and Monitoring

**Rule:** Use the provided tools for logging and debugging to maintain visibility into server-side operations and enable autonomous debugging capabilities.

**Implementation:**

- **Server Logging**: For all server-side logging, you must import and use the `serverLog` function from `src/core/infrastructure/monitoring/serverLogger.ts`.
- **Client-Side Logging**: For client-side debugging, use the `clientLog` utility from `src/core/infrastructure/monitoring/clientLogger.ts`. This utility provides:
  - **Environment-Aware Behavior**: Automatically detects browser vs server environments and handles logging appropriately
  - **Dual Storage**: Logs to console (both environments), file system (server-side), and localStorage (browser-side)
  - **Log Levels**: Standardized levels (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) with optional context
  - **Development-Only**: By default, logs are only shown in development mode. Use the `force` parameter to log in production if absolutely necessary.
  - **Async/Sync Options**: Use async functions (`debugLog`, `infoLog`, etc.) for proper error handling or sync versions (`debugLogSync`, `infoLogSync`, etc.) for fire-and-forget logging
  - **Avoid Raw `console.log`**: Replace all direct `console.log` calls with the appropriate utility for consistency and better control.
- **Autonomous Debugging**: Use the `DebugReader` class from `src/core/infrastructure/monitoring/debugReader.ts` for AI-powered debugging:
  - **Log Analysis**: `DebugReader.analyzeCurrentState()` provides comprehensive analysis of current system state
  - **Issue Detection**: Automatic detection of authentication, database, API, performance, and UX issues
  - **Health Monitoring**: `DebugReader.getSystemHealthReport()` provides real-time system health assessment
  - **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies common error patterns and provides actionable recommendations
  - **Search Capabilities**: `DebugReader.searchForIssue(query)` for targeted issue investigation
  - **Global Access**: In development, `window.KeystrokeDebug` provides browser console access to debugging utilities
- **Log Storage Locations**:
  - Server logs: `logs/server.log`
  - Client logs (server-side): `logs/client.log` (JSON format)
  - Client logs (browser-side): `localStorage` under `keystroke_client_logs`
- **Structured Logging**: Use structured logging with consistent log levels, timestamps, environment detection, and context preservation.
- **Error Tracking**: Integrate with error tracking services (Sentry) for production error monitoring. Automatic capture of uncaught errors and unhandled promise rejections.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track Core Web Vitals and custom performance metrics with autonomous pattern detection.

## 10. Communication and Proactiveness

**Rule:** Act as a proactive senior team member, not just a code generator.

**Implementation:**

- Challenge Suggestions: If a request is suboptimal, you must voice your concern, explain the potential issues, and propose a better alternative.
- Ask Clarifying Questions: If a task is ambiguous, ask for more details.
- Error Reporting: When encountering an error, provide a full description, context, and initial analysis.
- **Technical Debt Identification**: Proactively identify and propose solutions for technical debt.
- **Performance Impact Assessment**: Evaluate and communicate the performance impact of proposed changes.

## 11. Enhanced Error Handling

**Rule:** Errors must be handled gracefully at all layers of the application with comprehensive recovery strategies.

**Implementation:**

- UI Feedback: Use shadcn/ui components like Toast or Alert to provide clear, user-friendly feedback for non-critical errors.
- Error Boundaries: Wrap major sections of the UI in React Error Boundaries with informative fallback UIs.
- Server Actions: Server actions must not throw raw errors to the client. Return structured error responses.
- Prisma Errors: Always wrap database calls in try/catch blocks using handlePrismaError utility.
- **Error Recovery Strategies**: Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Design features to degrade gracefully when dependencies fail.
- **User-Friendly Error Pages**: Create custom 404, 500, and other error pages with helpful navigation.
- **Error Tracking Integration**: Automatically capture and categorize errors for analysis.
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Implement circuit breakers for external service calls.

## 12. Advanced Security Measures

**Rule:** Implement defense-in-depth security with comprehensive protection layers.

**Implementation:**

- Server-Side Validation: All data submitted from the client must be re-validated on the server using Zod schemas.
- Authorization Checks: Every server action must verify user session and role permissions.
- Preventing XSS: Properly sanitize or escape user-generated content.
- Environment Variables: Never expose sensitive keys on the client side.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement and maintain strict CSP headers.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for server actions and API endpoints.

```typescript
// Example rate limiting pattern
const rateLimiter = new Map();
const RATE_LIMIT = 100; // requests per minute
const WINDOW_MS = 60 * 1000;
```

- **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize inputs beyond validation, especially for rich text content.
- **Secure Headers**: Configure security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.).
- **Branded Types for Sensitive Data**: Use branded types for passwords, tokens, and sensitive IDs.
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Always use parameterized queries and Prisma's built-in protections.

## 13. Consistent Server Action and API Design

**Rule:** All server actions and API endpoints must follow a consistent design pattern for predictability and ease of use.

- **Consistent Error Codes**: Use standardized error codes and messages across all endpoints.

## 14. Comprehensive Testing Strategy

**Rule:** Implement a multi-layered testing approach covering unit, integration, and end-to-end scenarios.

**Implementation:**

- Unit Tests: Use Vitest or Jest for pure functions and utilities with high coverage. Co-locate these tests with the code being tested.
- Integration Tests: Use React Testing Library for component interaction testing. Place component tests next to the component files.
- Server-Side Tests: Place all server-side tests (API routes, server actions, database operations) in the /tests folder.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Use Playwright for critical user journeys. Place E2E tests in /tests/e2e/ folder.
- **Visual Regression Tests**: Implement screenshot testing for UI consistency. Place in component folders as `ComponentName.visual.test.tsx`.
- **Performance Tests**: Add performance benchmarks for critical components. Co-locate with components or place in /tests/performance/.
- **Contract Tests**: Use contract testing for API integration points. Place in /tests/contracts/.
- **Test Data Management**: Use factories and fixtures for consistent test data. Place test utilities in /tests/utils/.
- **Test Organization Pattern**:
  - Component tests: `src/components/Button/Button.test.tsx`
  - Hook tests: `src/hooks/useAuth/useAuth.test.ts`
  - Utility tests: `src/utils/formatDate/formatDate.test.ts`
  - Server tests: `/tests/api/auth.test.ts`
  - E2E tests: `/tests/e2e/user-journey.spec.ts`
