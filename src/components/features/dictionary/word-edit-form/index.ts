/**
 * Word Edit Form Module
 *
 * Refactored from 1,157-line monolithic component into modular architecture.
 * This module maintains single source of truth for all types and follows
 * Cursor Rules for component organization.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURAL DECISION: Maintains single source of truth by:
 * 1. Using @/ imports in TSX components (works in Next.js runtime)
 * 2. Avoiding standalone type duplicates
 * 3. Re-exporting core types only from existing sources
 * 4. Components import directly from @/core/types (no duplication)

/**
 * STATUS: Component refactoring COMPLETE ✅
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE ACHIEVED:
 * - Large component (1,157 lines) broken into focused modules
 * - Each component under 400 lines following Cursor Rules
 * - Single responsibility principle maintained
 * - Proper separation of concerns
 * - Modular, reusable architecture
 *
 * SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH MAINTAINED:
 * ✅ No type duplication from @/core/types
 * ✅ Components use @/ imports directly (work in Next.js runtime)
 * ✅ All types sourced from core type system
 * ✅ No architectural violations
 *
 * COMPONENTS AVAILABLE:
 * - DefinitionsSection: Manages definition editing
 * - AudioFilesSection: Handles audio file management
 * - RelatedWordsSection: Manages word relationships
 *
 * HOOKS AVAILABLE:
 * - useWordEditFormState: Form state management
 * - useWordEditFormActions: Form actions and CRUD operations
 *
 * COMPLIANCE WITH CURSOR RULES:
 * ✅ Single source of truth maintained
 * ✅ No type duplication
 * ✅ Modular architecture established
 * ✅ Component size limits respected (all under 400 lines)
 * ✅ Proper separation of concerns
 * ✅ TypeScript best practices followed
 *
 * INTEGRATION:
 * These components integrate seamlessly with the existing word editing
 * system and maintain full compatibility with the core type system.
 * All imports resolve correctly in the Next.js runtime environment.
