3. In section Translation: we need to show a DefinitionToOneWord of definition in the baseLanguage (now we have {Translation: which belongs exclusively or unconditionally to or concerns oneself or the person concerned} it is not correct) -->

next: 4. When I choose a wrong character (in the wrong order) I hear a sound of a wrong character and amound of attempts becomes -1 then this current worong entry is rejected and I try to type again. When attempts are finished I automatically get with a wrong answer to the wordCard, if typed everything correct I allso automatically get with a correct answer to the wordCard.

5. Review the settings of "Vocabulary Practice" and make sure that the settings are correct and works properly. Add in the settings sections for each practice type. For this particular "type Make Up the Word" amount of attemps, time limit, additionl characters, etc.
