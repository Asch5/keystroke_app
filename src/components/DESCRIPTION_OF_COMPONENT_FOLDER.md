# Components Folder Structure

This document describes the organization and purpose of components in the `src/components` folder. The structure follows a hierarchical pattern based on functionality and domain.

## Overview

The components are organized into several main categories:

- **Features**: Domain-specific components organized by feature area
- **Layouts**: Application layout components
- **Providers**: Context and state providers
- **Shared**: Reusable utility components
- **UI**: Base UI components (from shadcn/ui)
- **Utils**: Component utilities and helpers

## üéØ **CRITICAL: Co-Located Testing Architecture**

Following CURSOR RULES, all component tests are **co-located** with their components:

### **Test File Locations**

- Component tests: `Component.test.tsx` (next to `Component.tsx`)
- Hook tests: `useHook.test.ts` (next to `useHook.ts`)
- Utility tests: `utils.test.ts` (next to `utils.ts`)

### **Testing Infrastructure**

- **Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Setup**: `src/test-setup.ts` (global mocks and configuration)
- **Config**: `vitest.config.ts` (test environment configuration)
- **Utilities**: `test-utils.ts` files for shared testing helpers

### **Running Component Tests**

```bash
pnpm test              # Watch mode
pnpm test:run         # Single run
pnpm test:ui          # Visual interface
pnpm test:coverage    # With coverage report
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Server-side tests (database, API integrations) are in `/tests/` folder with separate package.json. Never mix testing architectures.

## üöÄ Performance Optimization Features

### **React Performance Optimizations**

Following Cursor Rules for performance, all large components have been optimized with React performance patterns:

### üéµ **Audio System Components** (Database-Only Architecture)

**Core Audio Integration:**

- All components use `AudioService.playAudioFromDatabase()` for audio playback
- **Database Priority**: Real audio files from blob storage (primary source)
- **Web Speech API**: Browser TTS fallback for practice mode only
- **‚ùå No Google Cloud TTS**: Explicitly disabled to avoid unexpected costs

**Audio Components:**

- `useAudioPlayback.ts` - Reusable hook for database audio playback (used across dictionary, admin, and practice components)
- **Integration Points**: WordDetails, AdminDictionary, Practice components all use AudioService
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to Web Speech API when database audio unavailable

**Audio Architecture:**

```typescript
// Standard audio playback pattern
import { AudioService } from '@/core/domains/dictionary/services/audio-service';

// Database audio (primary)
await AudioService.playAudioFromDatabase(audioUrl);

// Web Speech API fallback (practice mode only)
await AudioService.playTextToSpeech(text, language);
```

## Component Development Guidelines

### Size and Responsibility

- **File Size Limit**: Components should rarely exceed 300-400 lines
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have one clear purpose
- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Break large components into smaller, composable parts

### Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for component files
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose
- Group related components in feature folders

### State Management

- Use custom hooks for complex state logic
- Keep state close to where it's used
- Leverage Redux for global state when needed

### Performance

- Use React.memo for expensive renders
- Implement useCallback and useMemo appropriately
- Lazy load components when beneficial

### Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include ARIA attributes where needed
- Ensure keyboard navigation support

### Mobile-First Design

- All components must be responsive
- Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes
- Test on multiple device sizes
