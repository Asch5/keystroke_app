Please write code following best practices for React 19 and Next.js 15.2.1-canary.5. Use Flowbite general style (not components) and include comments to explain your code.

1. **Explore the Latest Information**:

    - Research the latest documentation, updates, and best practices related to the topic.
    - Use the links provided in `.cursor/config.json` for React, Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, and other tools in our stack.
    - If any documentation is missing or outdated, ask for clarification or updated links.

2. **Analyze the Codebase**:

    - Review the current codebase to understand the existing architecture, patterns, and state of the project.
    - Identify relevant files, components, and utilities that relate to the question.
    - Ensure your answer aligns with the current implementation and follows the rules defined in `.cursor/config.json`.

3. **Follow Rules and Best Practices**:

    - Adhere to the code quality rules, linting standards, and architectural constraints defined in `.cursor/config.json`.
    - Use TypeScript, enforce strict typing, and avoid banned patterns (e.g., `any`, non-null assertions).
    - Include JSDoc comments for all functions and components.

4. **Provide a Detailed Answer**:

    - Start with a brief explanation of the solution.
    - Include code snippets that are fully typed, documented, and follow best practices.
    - Highlight any potential pitfalls or considerations.

5. **Verify and Validate**:
